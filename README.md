# Wayland Fixes
Fixes for various Wayland-related problems, because icbf searching for them again.
## Jetbrains Products
Because Jetbrains chose to use *Java* (yeah I know, cringe language) as the language behind their IDEs, it doesn't render properly (or at all) on Wayland.

To overcome this, run this in Terminal: `export _JAVA_AWT_WM_NONREPARENTING=1 && rider` - You may also pass the `export` into the desktop entry so that you can skip opening Terminal.

And before you say, "Java is a good language! BOO BOO SOB SOB" - No, it isn't.
## Maim doesn't work
Maim is a mess anyways, freezing and dying left and right on X11. Use Grim instead.

Packages: `grim`, `grimshot`

To take a screenshot, run this command (bind it to a key): `grimshot copy area`
## NVIDIA doesn't launch on Hyprland
What a surprise.

**Update**: Moved instructions over to Hyprland's [wiki](https://wiki.hyprland.org/Nvidia/).
## Unity Hub crashes on NVIDIA GPUs
This is most lilely because of a `libva` error, to fix it on Arch, run these commands:

1. Install the unofficial NVIDIA VAAPI Driver from elFarto: `paru -S nvidia-vappi-driver-git`
2. Run Unity Hub using `LIBVA_DRIVER_NAME=nvidia unityhub`
3. Done
## Flatpak Apps can't open FileChooser, etc
Note: This is only for Hyprland, it may or may not work for other Wayland compositors.
***

1. Install `xdg-desktop-portal`, `xdg-desktop-potal-gtk` and `xdg-desktop-portal-wlr`
2. Add an alias to your `.bashrc` or `.zshrc` named `hyprland`, here's the full line:
   * `alias hyprland="dbus-run-session Hyprland"`
3. Add this to your config:
```
exec-once=systemctl --user enable xdg-desktop-portal
exec-once=systemctl --user enable xdg-desktop-portal-wlr
exec-once=systemctl --user enable xdg-desktop-portal-gtk
exec-once=hash dbus-update-activation-environment 2>/dev/null && dbus-update-activation-environment --systemd DISPLAY WAYLAND_DISPLAY XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP
```
4. Done, restart your PC and it should be working again. Make sure you launch Hyprland using `hyprland`, or you can just use  a `.desktop` file with `dbus-run-session` inside the `exec` part.

## My OBS doesn't work :'(
I never got OBS to work properly under Wayland (well dmabuf or w/e works until you switch workspaces), so I just started using `wf-recorder` instead.

Package: `wf-recorder`

Command to record with audio: `wf-recorder -a`, and to record without audio: `wf-recorder`
## GTK Themes not applying everywhere
I don't know if this is a Wayland-specific issue, but I have only encountered it on Wayland, hence why it's here.
***
Let's say you are using the [Orchis](https://github.com/vinceliuice/Orchis-theme) theme and want it to apply to applications such as Thunar. Well, does this look correct?

No? It hurts your eyes right? Yeah thought so.
1. Install the theme of your liking, using Orchis in this example with Thunar as the file manager
2. Open up a terminal and write `export GTK_THEME=Orchis:dark` -- ThemeName:Variant
3. Write `thunar` to open Thunar and congrats, your theme is there and you saved your eyes!

You may wanna pass this to `/etc/environment` though so you don't have to export the variable yourself constantly.
## Cursor Themes not applying in Flatpak applications
I don't know if this is a Wayland-specific issue, but I have only encountered it on Wayland, hence why it's here.
***
1. Open up Flatseal
2. Press `All Applications`
3. In `Other files` add in `/home/YOUR_USERNAME/.icons`
4. Done, now you should see the cursor in Flatpak applications.
## Help help, Electron applications aren't running! Passthrough errors etc
No idea if this is tied to NVIDIA GPUs, but seems like it is. Anyways, launch your RAM-Hog application with these flags:

`application-name --enable-features=UseOzonePlatform --ozone-platform=wayland --use-gl=egl`

I have no idea why this happens for some, while for others it just works. But it's whatever I guess.
## NVIDIA Overclocking does not work
Blame NVIDIA, there's (afaik) no workaround for it atm.
## Discord is slow and laggy
Don't use the official Discord client, nor the AUR hacky electron-upgraded ones.

Instead, use [WebCord](https://github.com/SpacingBat3/WebCord) which wraps around the web version of Discord, while also respecting your privacy and blocking certain tracking.
## Do I have to pass flags to every Electron application for it to run in Wayland?
Yes and no. 

No if you make a file at `~/.config/electron-flags.conf` with the following contents:
```
--enable-features=UseOzonePlatform
--ozone-platform=wayland
```

Yes if the application is either from Flatpak and doesn't have read permissions for the file, **or** if the application simply just does not want to run on Wayland at all.

**For Flatpak applications to even run properly on Wayland, use Flatseal and remove the X11 Display Server permissions and only allow it to access Wayland.**
**Below is an example for Librewolf**

## Screensharing on WebCord
No clue, for some "it just works" after configuring portals (as seen above with xdg-desktop-*), and for some it just will not work.

In general, screensharing and OBS is a hit or miss, since they both are moody as shit.
